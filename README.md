# A Garden Gnome's Guide to Happy Houseplants

Built for the Software Engineering Super League (SESL) Finals

Prompt: Pick a problem or annoyance that you have experienced and build a product to solve it. This challenge statement is incredibly broad, so we want to provide a couple of guidelines and guardrails: While we don’t want to comment on what qualifies as a problem or annoyance for anyone, try to be specific here. Obviously, you can build another to-do list, if you wanted to, but make sure that you have a unique and personal insight on what existing to-do lists aren’t solving for. In this challenge, the problem that you pick and the way you present the solution plays a role in the evaluation. Also, remember that you don’t need a fully fleshed out product with all the bells and whistles – be intentional about what you build to solve the problem instead of doing a half-baked job trying to build too many features. Finally, the web app should be full-stack, meaning it should work on any device for any user rather than being tied to a specific session.
